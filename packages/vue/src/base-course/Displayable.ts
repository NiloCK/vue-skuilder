  /*
  TODO:

  This class and its interface are critical in this app - it defines the app's
  methodology, or its architecture of methodologies, for making inferences based on
  student performance.

  Some future directions:

  displayedSkill() should receive contextual data as well as the direct report of
  a user's interaction with this card. Context includes, eg, the status of the current
  study session (is the user on tilt? have there been leading Qs? have there been distractors?),
  the status of the user's interaction with the card (new? mature? history of resets?)

  displayedSkill() should reach out to a course (or just the card, or card-type?) in order to receive
  custom skill-dimension evaluators. EG: a card in the ear training course tagged 'articulation'
  could trigger a fetch of a particular evaluator fcn for articulation. In general, we
  want high-dimension evaluations.

  answers should be processed for the likelihood of non-substantive-incorrectness. eg,
  7 * 4 = 8 is much more likely to be a typo than a substantive error when compared
  with 7 * 4 = 21
