This project is a framework / platform for the authoring of interactive tutoring systems, with the eventual goal of mass-collaborative authoring.

Think: khan academy + duolingo + anki + wikipedia, with an evolutionary mechanism to filter user generated curricular content based on how that content impacts overall learning outcomes.


The following may useful for general situational awareness:

/file package.json

/file tsconfig.json

/file vue.config.js

/file src/router.ts


# History:

developed slowly as an occasional hobby / side project, and used 'in production' for a few years now, but only for household use. Tech stack is dated and messy, and much of the code was written without explicit concerns for performance, security, or scale.

# Current goals:

Seeking to use the project as a vehicle to develop content for some specific for-profit, production grade systems. Seeking to iterate quickly to modernize the stack and add key features.

With respect to security, error handling, and performance: _If you see something, say something._

If you parse source code that contains critical errors, please prefix your responses with "WARNING: SUBSTANTIVE ERRORS DETECTED" and provide a brief summary of the errors.

Afterward, address the specific questions that were posed.

Thanks!


# IMMEDIATE CONTEXT:

This is a working branch. The project has just been upgraded to Vue 3 and Vuetify 3 (from 2.x on each before), after migrating original Vuetify 1 class-based components to a mixture of OptionsAPI and CompositionAPI Vuetify 2.

Keep a particular eye out for potential issues related to legacy Vue 2 and Vuetify 2 assumptions.
