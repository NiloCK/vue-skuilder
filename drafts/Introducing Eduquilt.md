# Introducing eduQuilt [DRAFT]

eduQuilt is a platform for community-driven development of interactive tutoring systems, built with both the classroom teacher and the individual learner as first class citizens. Courses built with eduQuilt deliver content to learners in ways that:

- respect our best understanding of learning and skill development
- promote self-improvement over social comparison
- meet learners where they are, and move them efficiently through the course
- work inside the classroom, at home, on the bus, or on a plane
- improve over time, by virtue of accumulated experience with learners and continued refinement of course materials

A note on jargon: this blog has two intended audiences - educators and software developers. Wherever I define terms or elaborate on some topic that is part of your own everyday vocabulary, please assume that these parts are intended for readers with a different background.

This post will give a brief overview of problems that the platform aims to address and its approach to solving them.

## Forgetting is learning's greatest enemy

> "I know I did this last year, but I don't remember how to do it." - every math student

Knowledge has to be used in order to be retained. Classroom teachers face enormous time pressure delivering prescribed curriculum to large numbers of individual students in set time-frames. A teacher who has taught and assessed a particular skill is hard-pressed to include ongoing practice that refreshes this skill over the following weeks and months, but kicks themselves when they find that half of the class needs extensive refresher instruction when the same skill pops up two months later in a different context.

eduQuilt uses spaced-repetition algorithms to make skills and knowledge stick around for the long term. For any given skill or piece of information, learners are quizzed on scheduled intervals that guarantee ongoing familiarity while minimizing the total time spent working on it.

## Skills are complex

Primary teachers will be familiar with leveled reading systems, where emerging readers are observed working with texts that have been graded for difficulty (eg: a level A, B, C... book). Students who demonstrate fluency and comprehension with a level B book are graduated to level C, where they practice for some time before being assessed again. This system is representative of a necessary compromise between an educator's need to track progress and assign work in a manageable way, and the messy reality of skill development.

Reading is a complex skill where countless different sub-skills interact in complicated ways, individual to each reader and each encounter with individual texts (to name a few: phonetic fluency, word-recognition, endurance and working memory, vocabulary and knowledge of the multiple meanings of words across different contexts, background knowledge relevant to the text at hand, familiarity with idiomatic usages...). In reality, emerging readers will present great variety in their profile of these sub-skills (Jane might be around level *D* in many dimensions while at level *A* in endurance). Their weakest skills may bottleneck progress and saddle them with work that's simultaneously too easy in some respects and too hard in some others.

A core aim of eduQuilt is in developing nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of students. Course materials aren't modeled on a linear prerequisite model, but as a network. This allows for dynamically produced exercises and instruction that meet the individual needs of learners and reduce bottleneck effects.

## Building community and distributing competence

Both of the above involve using computers to manage fine-grained information to serve learners in ways that are prohibitively tedious for a classroom teacher to do manually. The level of personalization described above has traditionally been available only to those with professional tutors or informed, involved guardians.

This final element again exploits computers' abilities to manage lots of information simultaneously, but uses a resource unavailable to any tutor: the classroom itself. Teachers have always been aware that their own students are a tremendous resource. Students bring a variety of lived experiences, [something here about their being mutually invested in one another - friendship, teamwork, non-susceptibility to expert-blindness]. Every teacher leans on their students as co-teachers, and every healthy classroom benefits from peer-to-peer "can you help me with this one?" conversations.

A nagging difficulty persists in this happy arrangement - classrooms are heterogeneous environments, and students present with wide ranges of academic preparedness, socio-economic-status, and personal identification as learners. In practice, this results in students self-selecting as either *helpers* or *the helped*. Problems may be escalated according to an established pecking order of students ("I don't know - Sarah will probably have it done though") while lower-status students are never asked for help. The cycle continues, and students' self-identification hardens.

Students working on eduQuilt in the classroom will occasionally have their own work interrupted with a simple prompt: `Mike needs a hand. Go and help Mike`.

Because a computer can keep very close tabs on what exercises each student can successfully complete, successful peer-interventions can be arranged with high confidence, and opportunities for weaker students to act as teachers can be capitalized on. Because the act itself is so conspicuous, *perceived competence* and the *personal experience of competence* are distributed among the room.

## Why Quilts?

Quilts are:

- made of individual patches connected to one another by thread
- labour intensive
- cozy

Bodies of knowledge are:

- made of individual pieces of skill or information, interconnected by various threads
- painstakingly realized by individuals and communities over time
- (dare I say it?) *cozy*
